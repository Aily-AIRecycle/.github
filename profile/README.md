# Aily (Ai-recycle)

Aily (Ai-recycle) is a project focused on addressing the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) challenges of our time. By leveraging AI technology and automation, Aily aims to revolutionize waste management and recycling practices. It provides a sorting and collection device that directly addresses the ESG issues related to waste management.

Aily is a project that utilizes AI (Yolov5) to automate garbage sorting and collection. It consists of real hardware that can identify the type of garbage and automatically sort and collect it. Aily also includes a mobile app and a web interface that allow users to monitor the amount of garbage they have thrown away and view the locations where Aily is installed on a map.

## Introduction

In today's world, the importance of ESG (Environment, Society, and Governance) is widely recognized. Aily project aims to contribute to these areas by tackling waste management challenges. By automatically sorting and collecting garbage based on ESG-related keywords, Aily seeks to promote sustainable practices and minimize the impact of waste on the environment.

Aily (Ai-recycle) is a project aimed at revolutionizing the way garbage is sorted and collected. By leveraging AI (Yolov5), Aily's real hardware is capable of accurately identifying different types of garbage and automating the sorting process. This not only reduces the burden on individuals but also ensures efficient recycling practices.

## Social Impact

The Aily project recognizes that the environment holds significant importance in terms of social impact. With the increasing global temperature and the occurrence of extreme weather events, it has become crucial to take immediate action. Limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5â„ƒ and achieving a carbon-neutral society by 2050 are essential goals to mitigate the impact of climate change.

## Addressing Poor Sorting Practices

One of the major challenges in waste management is the indiscriminate mixing and discharge of recyclable resources due to poor sorting. A startling statistic reveals that more than 8 million tons of recyclable resources are improperly mixed and discharged each year, exceeding the amount of properly sorted and recycled resources.

Consequently, a significant budget is allocated to reclassify and collect these mixed waste materials. Despite these efforts, a substantial portion of the inadequately sorted waste ends up being incinerated or sent to landfills. This leads to the loss of valuable resources that could be recycled, contributing to environmental degradation on a global scale.

## Reducing Costs and Environmental Impact

Through the Aily project, the aim is to promote effective waste sorting and discharge outside of homes. By achieving this, significant reductions can be made in the funds required for reclassifying mixed waste and the social costs associated with the improper landfilling or incineration of resources.

The proper sorting and recycling of waste will not only contribute to the preservation of the environment but also unlock the potential value of discarded resources. By embracing the Aily project, we can work towards a more sustainable future by minimizing waste, conserving resources, and reducing the negative impact on our planet.


## Features

- **Garbage Identification and Sorting:** Aily uses AI (Yolov5) to analyze the garbage and determine its type, enabling automatic sorting.
- **Real-time Garbage Collection and Tracking:** The hardware component of Aily collects the sorted garbage in real-time, providing an efficient and convenient recycling solution.
- **Mobile App and Web Interface:** Aily offers both a mobile app and a web interface. Users can track the amount of garbage they have thrown away, view the locations of Aily installations on a map, and access additional features.
